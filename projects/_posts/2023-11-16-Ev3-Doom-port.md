**A complete port of Doom engine for EV3. Works very well for this hardware.**

Code on [Github](https://github.com/Seva167/ev3doom)

![screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Seva167/ev3doom/main/images/screenshot.png)

- Fully compatible with the original Doom
- Uses dithering for better graphics
- Music and sound are working (if you compile it with sound support)

You can download precompiled binary on [releases](https://github.com/Seva167/ev3doom/releases/latest) page

Port is based on [Doomgeneric](https://github.com/ozkl/doomgeneric)

For help create an issue on [github](https://github.com/Seva167/ev3doom/issues)

Enjoy!
